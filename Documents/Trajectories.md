> Different equations used in projectile motion to calculate time of flight, horizontal range, maximum height etc. 

Let
$O$ = Point of projection,  
$u$ = Velocity of projection, and  
$α$ = Angle of projection with the horizontal.  

Consider a point $P$ as the position of particle, after time $t$ seconds with $x$ and $y$ as co-ordinates, as shown in Fig. 1.30.

The equation of the path of a projectile or the equation of trajectory is given by

$$y=x\tan(\alpha)-\frac{gx^2}{2u^2\cos^2(\alpha)}$$

Since this is the equation of a parabola, therefore, the path traced by a projectile is a parabola. The following are the important equations used in projectiles:

1. The time of flight (t) of a projectile on a horizontal plane is given by

    $$t=\frac{2u\sin(\alpha)}{g}$$

2. The horizontal range (R) of a projectile is given by

    $$R=\frac{u^2\sin(2\theta)}{g}$$

    For a given velocity of projectile, the range will be maximum when sin $2α = 1$ or $α=45$.

3. The maximum height ($H$) of a projectile on a horizontal plane is given by

    $$H=\frac{u^2\sin^2(\alpha)}{2g}$$

4. The time of flight of a projectile when it is projected from O on an upward inclined plane as shown in Fig. 1.31, is given by

    $$t=\frac{2u\sin(\alpha=\beta)}{g\cos(\beta)}$$

    where $β$ is the inclination of plane OA with the horizontal.

    When the projectile is projected on a downward inclined plane, then

    $$t=\frac{2u\sin(\alpha+\beta)}{g\cos(\beta)}$$

5. The range of projectile when it is projected from O to B on an upward inclined plane, as shown in Fig: 1.31, is given by

    $$R=OB=\frac{2u^2\sin(\alpha-\beta)cos(\alpha)}{g\cos^2(\beta)}=\frac{u^2}{gcos^2(\beta)}[\sin(2\alpha-\beta)-sin(\beta)]$$

    For a given velocity of projectile, the range will be maximum when

    $$\alpha=45\degree+\frac{\beta}{2}=\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{\beta}{2}$$

    When the projectile is projected on a downward inclined plane, then

    $$R=\frac{2u^2\sin(\alpha+\beta)cos(\alpha)}{g\cos^2(\beta)}$$
