# Engine

An attempt to write a 2D vector based Graphical Adventure game engine from scratch, in C#, having no previous experience ever writing a game engine.

## Acknowledgments

- Many of the geometry methods are inspired by samples from [C# Helper](http://csharphelper.com/) written by Rod Stephens.
- A portion of code for Bézier curves has been ported from the awesome information found on [A Primer on Bézier Curves](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) by Pomax.
- Polygon path finding based on [code](http://alienryderflex.com/shortest_path/) posted by Darel Rex Finley.
- Tweener code based on [Glide](https://bitbucket.org/jacobalbano/glide) by Jacob Albano.
- Pieces of the [Clipper](http://angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) library by Angus Johnson have been integrated. I would use more, but I want to understand it first.
